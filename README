This is a NSE End of Day Data Downloader written in Python. It downloads daily EOD (End Of Day) data as well as historical data (past EOD data) for NSE EQ series and also the main indices. 

The data is directly downloaded from the NSE servers and can be directly imported into MetaStock as ASCII format using MetaStock downloader.

The files are created in the same directory as the program itself.
